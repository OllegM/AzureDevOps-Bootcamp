        <p class="lead"></p><p>In this new culture of trusting the teams doing the right things, the right way, one employee has released a change working from home. Apparently he deployed the change directly from Visual Studio using the infamous right-click-publish to update the website. The rest of the team does not have any clue about what has been deployed. Users now report that access to the database is lost. The system needs to recover quickly.</p>
